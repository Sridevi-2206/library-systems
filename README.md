# 📚 Modern Library Management System (LMS) Frontend

This repository contains a full-featured, single-page frontend application for a Library Management System, built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates core database operations using the browser's Local Storage API, providing a complete, runnable interface without requiring a backend server.

## ✨ Features

* **Modern Dashboard:** Provides an overview of key metrics (Total Books, Available, Checked Out).
* **Navigation:** Clean sidebar navigation to switch between the Dashboard and the Book Inventory.
* **CRUD Operations (Simulated):** Allows users to add, remove, and update the status (Check Out/In) of books.
* **Persistent Data:** Uses **Local Storage** to save all book data, so the information remains even after the browser window is closed and reopened.
* **Responsive Design:** Styled with custom CSS for a modern, clean, and intuitive user experience.
